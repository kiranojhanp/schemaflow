# ‚ö†Ô∏è **Status**: Development Paused

---

### Why the Pause?  
I realized that **storing state in `localStorage`** provides little benefits as it limits the ability to **share charts and data online**. To overcome this, I‚Äôm focusing on building a **sync layer** on top of `zustand`.

---

### üöÄ **What‚Äôs Next?**  
1. **Sync Layer**: Convert to local-first app.  
2. **Docker Distribution**: A `Dockerfile` for easy setup and deployment.  
3. **One-Click Deployment**: Support for platforms like **Vercel**.

### üí° **Use Existing Features!**  
Although new development is paused, you can still explore and enjoy the current functionality.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Stay Tuned for Updates**  
Thanks for your patience‚Äîexciting improvements are on the way!


# SchemaFlow

DBML visualizer that just works. Built with React Flow.

## The Story

I love DBML for its simplicity in defining database schemas. The official tool (dbdiagram.io) is great but those subscription prompts were driving me nuts. Looking for alternatives, I found... well, nothing good.

So I built SchemaFlow. Turns out making a decent DBML visualizer is trickier than I thought - had to write my own syntax highlighter for Monaco editor and everything. But hey, it works! 

Currently thinking about extracting the DB viewer into a separate package. We'll see.

## Features

- üé® Clean DBML visualization
- ‚úçÔ∏è Code editor with syntax highlighting
- üîÑ Live updates
- üì± Drag tables around
- üíæ Remembers table positions
- üåì Dark mode (because why not)
- üÜì Free, open source, no annoying prompts

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How to Use

1. Paste your DBML in the editor
2. Watch the magic happen
3. Move stuff around if you want
4. That's it!

## Example

```dbml
Table users {
  id integer [primary key]
  username varchar
  created_at timestamp
}

Table posts {
  id integer [primary key]
  title varchar
  author_id integer
}

Ref: posts.author_id > users.id
```

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- React Flow
- Monaco Editor
- Zustand
